# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree 

---

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Example 1:
- Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- Output: 3

### Example 2:
- Input: root = [1,null,2]
- Output: 2

### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Solution:

There are choices and sub-problems, so we can use Recursion.

* Draw recursion tree of choices and decisions
* Write code: Base condition - Induction - Hypothesis

The maximum depth is defined in the problem statement, we should follow that.

### Code:
```kotlin
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        
        return 1 + Math.max(maxDepth(root.left), maxDepth(root.right));
    }
}
```

### Explanation
#### Base Condition
If there is no node, then maxDepth is zero.
```kotlin
if (root == null) return 0;
```

#### Induction
Current node's maximum depth is calculated by adding 1 to maximum of left and right sub-trees' maximum depths.
```kotlin
return 1 + Math.max(maxDepth(root.left), maxDepth(root.right));
```

#### Hypothesis

We have to trust that these will give us the maximum depths of the left and right sub-trees, respectively.

Left sub-tree's maximum depth:
```kotlin
maxDepth(root.left)
```
Right sub-tree's maximum depth:
```kotlin
maxDepth(root.right)
```
